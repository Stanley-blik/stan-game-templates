# 🎮 stan-game-templates: Modular Core Projects (MCPs)

The official, community-driven library of **Modular Core Projects (MCPs)** and Starter Kits used by the **Stan AI** platform to accelerate Unity game development.

This repository is the **source of truth** for all foundational project structures, tested code templates, and configuration files that Stan uses for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

## 🎯 Why This Repo Exists

Stan does not generate code from scratch. When a user requests a new feature or game, Stan pulls a corresponding, tested **Modular Core Project (MCP)** from this library and intelligently modifies it. This ensures:

* **Quality & Stability:** All generated code integrates with a clean, pre-configured Unity project setup.
* **Speed:** Drastically reduces generation time by referencing existing, high-quality C# scripts instead of generating boilerplate code.
* **Community Scaling:** Allows Unity experts to submit new game templates, expanding Stan's capabilities for every user.
