# Sci-Fi Survival Template

## Overview
A template for creating science fiction survival games set in hostile alien worlds or derelict space stations with resource management and technology crafting.

## Core Requirements
1. Hostile environment hazards and alien creatures
2. Advanced technology crafting and equipment upgrading
3. Base building and defensive structures
4. Story-driven exploration with lore discovery

## Essential Systems

### Environmental Hazard System
- Purpose: Create dynamic threats from the alien environment
- Components: Atmospheric processor, hazard detector, protective gear
- Implementation: Timed exposure mechanics with cumulative effects

### Technology Crafting System
- Purpose: Enable progression through advanced equipment fabrication
- Components: Research tree, fabrication bench, component management
- Implementation: Multi-stage crafting with rare material requirements

## Assets Required

### Sci-Fi Equipment Models
- Type: 3D Models
- Quantity: 50-100 equipment items and structures
- Specifications: Consistent futuristic aesthetic with emissive materials

## Best Practices
- Balance resource scarcity with player progression needs
- Design distinctive alien creatures with unique behaviors
- Create atmospheric storytelling through environmental details

## Common Pitfalls
- Making resource gathering tedious rather than engaging
- Poor pacing of technology unlocks breaking immersion
