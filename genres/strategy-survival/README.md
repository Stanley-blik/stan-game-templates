# Strategy Survival Template

## Overview
A template for creating strategy games with survival elements, resource management, and tactical decision-making in hostile environments.

## Core Requirements
1. Resource gathering and management systems
2. Survival mechanics with health, hunger, and environmental hazards
3. Tactical combat with strategic positioning
4. Base building and defensive structures

## Essential Systems

### Resource Management
- Purpose: Enable strategic allocation of limited supplies
- Components: Inventory system, production chains, consumption tracking
- Implementation: Data-driven approach with supply and demand mechanics

### Survival Mechanics
- Purpose: Create tension through character needs and environmental threats
- Components: Health system, needs tracker, hazard detector
- Implementation: Layered survival systems with escalating consequences

## Assets Required

### Strategic Assets
- Type: 2D/3D Models and UI Elements
- Quantity: 100-200 assets for structures, resources, and interfaces
- Specifications: Clear visual hierarchy for strategic information

## Best Practices
- Design meaningful choices with resource trade-offs
- Create clear visual feedback for survival states
- Balance challenge to maintain tension without frustration

## Common Pitfalls
- Making resource management too tedious or micromanagement-heavy
- Poorly balanced survival mechanics leading to unfair deaths
