## Essential Systems

### Technology Research
- Purpose: Enable progression through advanced sci-fi technologies
- Components: Research tree, lab system, unlock manager
- Implementation: Prerequisite-based unlocking with specialization paths

### Futuristic Combat
- Purpose: Implement tactical combat with sci-fi elements
- Components: Weapon system, shield mechanics, special abilities
- Implementation: Cover-based combat with energy-based weapons

## Assets Required

### Sci-Fi Assets
- Type: 3D Models
- Quantity: 100-200 futuristic military assets
- Specifications: Consistent sci-fi aesthetic with advanced technology visuals

## Best Practices
- Design clear visual feedback for energy-based weapons
- Create balanced unit roles with counterplay relationships
- Implement intuitive UI for complex tactical information

## Common Pitfalls
- Overcomplicating technology systems leading to analysis paralysis
- Poorly balanced units creating dominant strategies
