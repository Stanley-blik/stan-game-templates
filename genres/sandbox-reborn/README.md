# Sandbox Reborn Template

## Overview
A template for creating sandbox games with renewed creative freedom, building mechanics, and emergent gameplay systems.

## Core Requirements
1. Creative building and construction systems
2. Resource gathering and crafting mechanics
3. Dynamic world with emergent events
4. Player-driven narrative and goal setting

## Essential Systems

### Building System
- Purpose: Enable creative construction and environment modification
- Components: Placement manager, structural integrity, blueprint system
- Implementation: Grid-based or free-form building with physics integration

### Crafting Mechanics
- Purpose: Allow creation of items and structures from raw materials
- Components: Recipe system, crafting station, ingredient manager
- Implementation: Tiered crafting with skill-based progression

## Assets Required

### Building Assets
- Type: 3D Models with Connection Points
- Quantity: 200-500 modular building components
- Specifications: Seamless connection points for creative construction

## Best Practices
- Design intuitive building interfaces with precision controls
- Create clear visual feedback for structural integrity
- Balance resource scarcity with creative freedom

## Common Pitfalls
- Poor building interface leading to frustration
- Overly complex crafting systems deterring players
